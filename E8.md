#### Application Control

##### Notes

- Applocker is required for E8 to control the execution of scripts in user profiles

- App Control for Business/Applocker only reports failure events to Advanced Hunting, Successful events are not logged. This can make it hard to find if a policy is working or not as you are looking for something that isn't there

- App Control for Business's Intelligent Security Graph is incompatible with Essential 8

- Microsoft isn't the only company that does App Control, If App Control for Business + AppLocker is to difficult to manage (It is a complicated/frustrating process, especially to start, even more so if you don't have your apps package). [Airlock](https://www.airlockdigital.com/) and [ThreatLocker](https://www.threatlocker.com/) are great alternatives

	- App Control for Business Events = AppControl**CodeIntegrity** XYZ
	- AppLocker Events = **AppControl** XYZ

- [KQL for App Control Wizard](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WDAC-Toolkit/blob/main/WDAC-Policy-Wizard/docs/using/advanced-hunting.md) - This Advanced Hunting query will get you the information you need for the App Control Wizard
