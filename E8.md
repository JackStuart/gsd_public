**Summary**

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents), to help organisations protect themselves against various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight. The Essential Eight has been designed to protect organisations’ internet-connected information technology networks. While the principles behind the Essential Eight may be applied to enterprise mobility and operational technology networks, it was not designed for such purposes and alternative mitigation strategies may be more appropriate to defend against unique cyber threats to these environments.

[The Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight), first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation of the Essential Eight. It is based on ASD’s experience in producing cyber threat intelligence, responding to cyber security incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.

#### Application Control

##### Notes

- Applocker is required for E8 to control the execution of scripts in user profiles

- App Control for Business/Applocker only reports failure events to Advanced Hunting, Successful events are not logged. This can make it hard to find if a policy is working or not as you are looking for something that isn't there

- App Control for Business's Intelligent Security Graph is incompatible with Essential 8

- Microsoft isn't the only company that does App Control, If App Control for Business + AppLocker is to difficult to manage (It is a complicated/frustrating process, especially to start, even more so if you don't have your apps package). [Airlock](https://www.airlockdigital.com/) and [ThreatLocker](https://www.threatlocker.com/) are great alternatives
