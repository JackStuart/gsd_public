I admit it's my fault ðŸ˜†, as I started collecting all the useful links that I had in OneNote from the last 5 years of helping Microsoft Partners grow their Security business, as well as some of the great content that was now coming across my desk here in Microsoft - it just seemed to make sense to get it out of OneNote and into somewhere more accessible to help reduce friction for Customers and Partners wanting to get stuff done.
