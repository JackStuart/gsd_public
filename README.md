# Get Security Done

Inspired by Mark Simos’s “Mark’s List” and a discussion after an “In to the Breach” training exercise over a few beers it was discussed that there should be a local version focused more around “Getting Security Done” (hence the short link to GSD) with a specific focus on the M365 Security platform, but not restricted to just that as we'd like to adopt a very customer centric view point on this. (of course here in Australia we might typically refer to this as Get Shit Done - hence the GSD acronym)

So with that planning got under way to create https://aka.ms/GSD, and of course we could always refer to this as Global Security Deployment? Please be aware this should always be considered a "work in progress" and will be updated as we go.

Please note this will be a mix of both Microsoft & non-Microsoft content, if it is of value and can help you with said mission of GSD for Security in the Microsoft Platform, then we'd like to include it - having said that, please feel free to provide feedback on the good, the bad and the ugly as we'd like to improve this over time.
