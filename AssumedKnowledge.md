## Assumed Knowledge

This project is intended to remove friction to "getting shit done" and as such there is a certain amount of "assumed knowledge" that you are already somewhat experienced with the Microsoft Defender Security Suite of tools - in particular the 4 main pillars of MDI, MDE, MDO and MDCA (was MCAS) - if not then please consider having a good review of the Core Reference material below.

However, if you've already got a reasonably good handle on this, don't let us stop you - dive straight in and "get shit done" ;-)

## Core reference material:

-   **Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture -- <https://aka.ms/MCRA>** [Direct link](<https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/security/blob/main/Downloads/microsoft-cybersecurity-reference-architectures.pptx?raw=true>)  
-   **Security collateral inc. CISO Workshops, and lots more -- <https://aka.ms/MarksList>**
    -   Please - if you haven't come across these two links above before now - feel free to go and review and come back after and pick up here when done.

Please make sure you review the MCRA slide deck & slide 15 - all of the slide is hyperlinked to other additional useful info - so have a good browse first and then if you have further questions on these 4 solution areas it might be worth reviewing the Ninja Training section?
