#### Application Hardening

#### Application Control

##### Notes

- Applocker is required for E8 to control the execution of scripts in user profiles

- App Control for Business/Applocker only reports failure events to Advanced Hunting, Successful events are not logged. This can make it hard to find if a policy is working or not as you are looking for something that isn't there

- App Control for Business's Intelligent Security Graph is incompatible with Essential 8

- Microsoft isn't the only company that does App Control, If App Control for Business + AppLocker is to difficult to manage (It is a complicated/frustrating process, especially to start, even more so if you don't have your apps package). [Airlock](https://www.airlockdigital.com/) and [ThreatLocker](https://www.threatlocker.com/) are great alternatives

#### Multi-factor authentication

#### Patch Applications

#### Patch Operating Systems

#### Restrict administrative privileges

#### Regular backups

#### Restrict Microsoft Office macros

- [ACSC's guide to disabling Macros](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/restricting-microsoft-office-macros) - Very good guide - Shows 6 different ways to set macro's, Along with the benefits/fritction. All these options can be set in Intune/GPO
- [Powershell Testing Scripts](https://github.com/JackStuart/Scripts/tree/main/Macros) - Scripts that you can run to confirm what settings are enabled are disabled, Easily customisable to whatever settings you want to test
