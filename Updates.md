!!! tip Most folks skip Defender in preference for Sentinel?  
    -   Start from the desired outcome and work your way back from there
    -   What is it that SecOps need? - more automation, less manual work ;-)
    - What does that look like? Showcase an example from Contoso Hotels
    - Enable Automated Investigation & Remediation (AIR) at MDI, MDO, MDE and M365 Defender console levels - **don't skip this!**
    -   Now that we have the first level triage in place, let's now move on to Sentinel...

Not everybody consumes info in the same way, but this is how I consume/manage the constant flow of info:
-   Text, links and graphics (pptx and pdf preferably) so that I can skim FAST
-   Others like Video, I find it too time consuming
-   Plus I focus on searching for the great content & then tracking the people that created that and build a network
